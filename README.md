# **UX**

The website is designed with simplicity & effectiveness in mind, allowing users to quickly preview desired products and checkout within minutes. All product content is clearley structured and very thorough. Design is very clear and consistent which helps the user to navigate through the website with ease. Upon each user action, system either informs them or asks for the premission (deleting product off the basket/checkout. Adding to basket etc.)


# **Research and Analysis Phase**

## **Brainstorming Ideas & User Stories**

For this project, I wanted to build an e-commerce website, but I was unsure at the start where to get the product data. After sucessfully finding shoes product data, I decided to create Adidas oriented footware shop. After some research on usual brand colours, and website funcitonality I decided to proceed with planning and wireframing/designing.

**Long term goals:**

- Allow users to log-in using social media accounts.
- Creating tracking system within the profile page
- Implementing auto-address plug in to help the users to quickly fill in their details
- Adding more products and batter filtering system (shoe color, size etc.)

### **User Stories**

# **Design Phase**

## **Sitemap**

Sitemap creation allowed me to brainstorm website structure and decide which pages will be included - view [here](media/footlook-sitemap.png).

## **Colour palette & Typography**

Colour Pallet was determined while re-searching for usual brand colours and darker theme options. Typography was selected on purpose to display nice headings and clean body text.

## **Wireframes**

All wireframes were created in InVision Studio, and all of them were created as deatailed as possible to allow development/implementation phase to focus on code specifically. They can all be previewed here [here](media/wireframes).
